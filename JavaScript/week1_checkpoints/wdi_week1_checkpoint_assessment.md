3. Copy `angel.txt` into the `vamps` directory
<br><br>

4. Delete the `vamps` directory and everything inside it
<br><br>

2. Using the `captain` variable, use string concatenation to form the string "Oh Jack, my Jack!", assigning it to a variable named `phrase`
<br><br>


### JS Conditionals
```js
var souls = 3;
var lifeRafts = 2;
```

1. Write an `if` statement that console.logs "SOS!" if there are more _souls_ than _lifeRafts_
<br><br>


### Data Structures - JS Arrays

4. Access 'Saturday' in the array and assign to a variable named `day`
<br><br>

5. Remove 'Friday' from the array
<br><br>

### Data Structures - JS Objects

1. Write an object literal named `brain` having a property of `energyLevel` with a value of `10`
<br><br>

2. Assign the property of `energyLevel` to a variable named `energy`
<br><br>

3. Add a `dream` property to the `brain` object that holds the string  'electric sheep'
<br><br>

### JS Functions

1. Write a function to return the area of a rectangle (the product of its length and its width)
